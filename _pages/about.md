* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Mathematics Department](https://web.math.rochester.edu/) at [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), advised by Prof. [Frederick Cohen](https://web.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/cohf/). You can see my [[Resume](http://anumoshsad.github.io/files/ResumeRecent.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Czu1NUcAAAAJ&hl=en)]
* My primary research interest in pure math lies in the area of Algebraic Topology, specifically Polyhedral Products/ Moment-Angle complexes. I am also highly interested in the general area of machine learning such as Supervised Learning, Applied AI, Fairness in AI, Network Prunning.
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree from [the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) with a major in Pure Mathematics. My undergraduate research advisor was Prof. [Toshitake Kohno](https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kohno/).
