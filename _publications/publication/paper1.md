title: "Genus of the hypercube graph and real moment-angle complexes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper1
excerpt: 'In this paper we demonstrate a calculation to find the genus of the hypercube graph $Q_n$ using real moment-angle complex  where  is the boundary of an n-gon. We also calculate an upper bound for the genus of the quotient graph , where  represents the cyclic group with n elements.'
