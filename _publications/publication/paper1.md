title: "Genus of the hypercube graph and real moment-angle complexes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper1
excerpt: 'In this paper we demonstrate a calculation to find the genus of the hypercube graph $Q_n$ using real moment-angle complex $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{K_n}}(D^1,S^0)$ where $\mathcal{K_n}$ is the boundary of an $n$-gon. We also calculate an upper bound for the genus of the quotient graph $Q_n/C_n$, where $C_n$ represents the cyclic group with n elements.'
